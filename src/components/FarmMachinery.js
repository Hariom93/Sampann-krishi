                <p className='text-gray-600 mt-3'>Various types of modern agriculture machinery and technology are used in
                    different agricultural operations nowadays. Different levels in crop production
                    include â€“ Primary and secondary level tillage of the soil, Seeding and planting,
                    Cultivation, Fertilizer application and distribution, Pest control, Harvesting,
                    Irrigation, Drainage ,Transportation, Storage, Handling the residues of earlier
                    crops etc.</p>
                <p className='text-gray-600 mt-4'>Since the olden times, animals were the primary source of energy when it was about
                    tough jobs in farming. Later on, steam power started replacing the same. And then
                    gas-powered tractors took over, followed by diesel engines. In the developed nations,
                    it caused lowering the number of farmworkers, however, farm production continuously
                    increased with the use of agriculture machinery.</p>
                <p className='text-gray-600 mt-4'>Technology in agriculture has transformed and increased production and quality of
                    produces. In modern times, farmers who are doing heavy works on farms using
                    traditional and old agriculture tools are wasting their health and time. A tractor
                    that used to be known as a technological genius in the agricultural field is old
                    news now. The modern farm machinery has upgraded the agricultural industry for the
                    best. Some of the essential and most used machinery are Combine or Combine Harvester,
                    Rotavator or Rotary Tiller, Plough or Plow, Tractor Trailer, Power Harrow, Leveler,
                    water bowser, ripper machine, and disc harrow. Below we have mentioned a few of the
                    latest agriculture machinery and their uses in farming.</p>
                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold my-5'>Plough</h1>
                <p className='text-gray-600'>Plough, a primary tillage equipment works as a tractor implement attached
                    with a tractor and helps in tilling the land efficiently. This remarkable
                    piece of agricultural machinery is used for preparing the land in the
                    planting season. Either its about turning an all new land into a farm or just
                    preparing existing farm to sow seeds, various types of plough
                    (mould-board plough, reversible plough, disc plough)
                    allow farmers to turn the soil into a nutrient rich
                    seedbed for better plant growth.</p>
                <img src='https://www.fieldking.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Plough-1-768x428.jpg' className='h-[40vh] w-[40vw] m-4' />
                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold mb-5'>Combine Harvester</h1>
                <p className='text-gray-600'>Bigger in size a Combine works like a comb cutter for cutting the mature crops
                    with threshing at the same time. A combine is one of the most upgraded
                    machinery that helps farmers by saving long hours of the day wasting in
                    harvesting activities.</p>
                <img src='https://www.fieldking.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Combine-Harvester-1-768x428.jpg' className='h-[40vh] w-[40vw] m-4' />
                <p className='text-gray-600'>The multi-crop combine harvester is designed in such a way that it is
                    compatible for harvesting multiple grain crops such as wheat, corn, barley,
                    grain sorghum, soybeans, oats, sunflower, rice. A modern multi-crop harvester
                    makes harvesting faster so that the fields can be open for the next crop in
                    minimum period of time, and the probability of production increases within the
                    period.</p>
                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold my-5'>Rotavator or Rotary Tiller</h1>
                <p className='text-gray-600'>A rotavator or rotary tiller is a versatile tillage equipment that uses a series
                    of blades, to turn up the soil. Rotary tillers are quite popular among farmers to
                    make easy the preparation of seedbed in the farms. The equipment is mainly used
                    for breaking soil in lawns, farms, gardens, etc. The use of rotary tillers has
                    significantly increased in agricultural operations because of its simple built
                    and high-end efficiency as a tillage implement.</p>

                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold mb-5'>Disc Harrow</h1>
                <p className='text-gray-600'>The disc harrow is one of the essential tillage implements that farmers can
                    invest into, to increase their production. This tillage equipment is also
                    used in secondary tillage process as it helps in breaking up lumps of the
                    soil easily, efficiently and faster to give it a rich finish when it comes to
                    prepare a final seedbed. It also allow farmers to control weeds around the
                    plants once the crop is planted and grown.</p>
                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold my-4'>Leveler</h1>
                <p className='text-gray-600'>
                    This tractor implements make the soil more levelled, smooth and surface obtained,
                    enabling it to create a moist environment for crops and reducing consumption of
                    fertilizers, seeds, chemical and fuel.
                </p>
                <h1 className='text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 my-3'>Conclusion</h1>
                <p className='text-gray-600'>With the use of the above mentioned modern agriculture machinery and
                    technology nowadays farming has improved more like a science than art.
                    The sole purpose of using the technology and machinery in agriculture is
                    improving productivity, efficiency and making farming more sustainable.</p>
